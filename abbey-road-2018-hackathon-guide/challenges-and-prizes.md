# Challenges and Prizes

## Challenges

We don’t want  to be too prescriptive with our challenges, those are rather themes and conversation starters. If you want to find out more chat to any of our mentors and tech partners on the day.

Theme \#1 Creation: Imagine how music will be created 20 years from now and try to sketch the tool/instrument from the future.

Theme \#2 Production: Use any of the given tools to assist music/audio production

1 Shazam for Samples: I’m a producer and I really want to use that horn I just heard on James Brown’s track. How do I find it? Can you use computer vision \(spectrogram analysis\) or speech recognition \(lyrics extraction\) to achieve that? How do I recreate this sound if I can’t find it \(physical modelling\)? Finally, how to help with smart choice, if the artists looks for a drum pack and has 1000 to choose from can we assist in that process? 

2 Second Verse Syndrome: I’m a songwriter and struggling for ideas. Use all given tools to inspire songwriters of the future

3 Smart Studio: connect as many pieces of equipment from our studio to your Raspberry Pie, what new data sets /control & monitoring levels could you get? 

4 Real time production: how could you level life broadcasting so it sounds good on many level. What if 5 artists based in different locations want to perform together? How would you cope with signal delay? 

5 Picture music: How could you use Vision API to compose music from pictures or videos 

6 Crowdsourced music: Could musicians input somehow from multiple locations, to create a masterpiece that interweaves the ideas from all over the world 

7 Intelligent DJ: Can a computer help DJs find similar tracks with similar qualities including not just rhythm, tempo and key but also mood, lyrical theme to help them create a set 

8 Jamming with a computer: Could you train the AI to ‘play music’ and jam with you based on cues e.g. recognize a certain lyric in a song and have it play a melody when it hears it, or sing a duet and use Cognitive Services to trigger different effects and sounds when it identifies a particular person’s voice. 

9 Face music: Use your face to play a song. Have Face API detect your emotions and trigger different sounds, samples, parameters or effects. Could the mood of the music change based on facial emotion? 

10 Co-writer: Could AI analyse music and suggest chords / progressions / melodies that work with your song 

11 Automatic Mixing: Can we use AI to identify and quickly execute common, low level mixing tasks? For example, there’s a plugin called a de-esser, which makes “s” sounds in vocals less harsh- maybe cognitive services can quickly set parameters for it automatically? More generally, can we use cognitive services to automate simple, functional mix fixes intelligently like this so producers and engineers have more time to be creative with their work? 

12 Melody Check: Sam Smith was sued by Tom Petty couple years ago bc he copied a melody from one of his songs without realizing it, and nobody caught it until the song was already out. Can we build a service that automatically compares melodies and harmonies with a music database to determine the likelihood of a copyright violation? 

13 Frequency Identifier: Experienced engineers can identify the sonic characteristics of certain frequencies when they are mixing. This allows them to identify problems with mix and fix them by turning down certain frequencies, or to bring out certain desired qualities in the sound by boosting them. Can we build a tool that analyses sounds in real time and creates a visual breakdown that helps describe what aspects of the sound are contained in each frequency, thereby helping mix engineers figure out which parts of the sound they are looking for more quickly?

## Competition:

When thinking about your ideas try to think about creative process and the artists, how would you explain your idea to musician, how would you present it? You will be judged on creativity and originality of your ideas and you have to present your hack on stage in the simple accessible way \( power point/video/live stream/running code accompanied by pitch style commentary\).Be open to the ideas of the others and mentorship, and join the group you like the most \(we need you to have teams of 5 or more\). 

The teams will be judged by top industry experts, including: Isabel Garvey, MD, Abbey Road Studios, Jay Katsuyama, VP Technology, Universal Music Group, Steve Kelly Senior Director of Innovation and Technology, Universal Music Group, Noelle LaCharite Leading Applied AI DevEx, Microsoft, Krzysztof Kogutkiewicz CEO, Miquido David Hawkes Managing Director, Commercial \(UK\) Universal Music Group
