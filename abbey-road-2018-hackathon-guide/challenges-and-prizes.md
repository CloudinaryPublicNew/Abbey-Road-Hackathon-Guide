# Challenges and Prizes

## Challenges

We don’t want to be too prescriptive with our challenges, so those are themes and conversation starters rather than briefs. If you want to dig deeper, chat to any of our mentors and tech partners on the day.

### **Theme \#1- Creation: Imagine how music will be created 20 years from now and try to sketch a tool/instrument from the future.**

How can future instruments span distances, inspire and aid creativity? Can we design an instrument for the future that is more inclusive in terms of ability, mobility, skill or budget? Does an instrument have to be one object played by one person? How can we enable people to make their own bespoke instruments? 

### Theme \#2 - Production: What problems do writers / producers face in the studio today? Use any of the given tools to assist in the composition / audio production process.

**1. Shazam for Samples:** _I’m a producer and I really want to use that horn I just heard on James Brown’s track. How do I find it? Can you use computer vision \(spectrogram analysis\) or speech recognition \(lyrics extraction\) to achieve that? How do I recreate this sound if I can’t find it \(physical modeling\)? How can I make smarter choices in selecting the right sample from a large library?_

**2. Second Verse Syndrome:** _I’m a songwriter and struggling for ideas. How can you use text and sentiment analysis to facilitate the creative process? Could AI analyse music and suggest chords / progressions / melodic ideas that might work with my track?_ 

**3. Smart Studio:** _Connect as many pieces of equipment from our studio to your Raspberry Pi, what new effects / data sets / control & monitoring levels could you achieve?_ 

**4. Real time production:** _What if 5 artists based in different locations want to perform live together? How would you cope with signal delay?_ 

**5. Picture-based music:** _Could you use Vision API to compose music from pictures or videos? Or Face API to perform a track using a crowd of people?_

**6. Crowdsourced music:** _How could you build a tool that crowdsources audio contributions from around the world to generate music?_

**7. Intelligent DJ:** _Can a computer help DJs find similar tracks with similar qualities including not just rhythm, tempo and key but also mood, lyrical theme to help them create a set?_

**8. Jamming with a computer:** _Could you train an AI to jam with you based on certain cues?_ 

**9. Automatic Mixing:** _Can we use AI to identify and quickly execute common, low level mixing tasks, e.g. de-essing? Or identify problematic frequencies without having to EQ sweep? More generally, can we use cognitive services to automate the mixing process intelligently so producers and engineers have more time to be creative with their work?_ 

**10. Copyright Check:** _Sam Smith was sued by Tom Petty couple years ago because he reproduced a melody from one of his songs without realizing it, and nobody caught it until the song was already out. Can we build a service that automatically compares melodies and harmonies with a music database to determine the likelihood of a copyright violation?_ 

## Competition:

When thinking about your ideas, try to think about artists and the creative process. How would you explain your idea to a musician? You'll be judged on creativity and originality and will need to present your hack on stage in a simple accessible way  like PowerPoint, video, live stream or running code with commentary. Be open to the ideas of the others and mentorship, and join the group you like the most \(we need you to have teams of 5 or more\). 

**The teams will be judged by top industry experts, including:**

* **Isabel Garvey, MD, Abbey Road Studios**
* **Jay Katsuyama, VP Technology, Universal Music Group**
* **Steve Kelly, Senior Director of Innovation and Technology, Universal Music Group,**
