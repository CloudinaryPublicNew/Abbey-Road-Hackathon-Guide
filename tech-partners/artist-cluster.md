# Artist Cluster

The artist cluster is graph theoretical network that tracks over 4 million artists, connects them by listener overlaps and groups them into measured genre clusters. It also contains basic demographics, interests, brands, hobbies of over 400,000 artists. There are even some A&R KPIS to find new talents to explore. Universal uses the API for research purposes, to find and track new artists and to give user recommendations.

**\*\* Access to the tool and the API will only be given during the hackathon only.**
