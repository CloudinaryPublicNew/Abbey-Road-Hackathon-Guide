# Gracenote

![](../.gitbook/assets/gracenote_logo.png)

The Gracenote Web API delivers a rich set of music metadata over HTTP to help power interactive experiences for any connected application. This allows text-based lookups of music artists, albums and tracks, and returns descriptive metadata such as genre, region of origin, and mood, as well as Cover Art, Artist Images, biographies, and other related content items. Additional modes of lookup such as CD or audio recognition require the use of one of Gracenote's other platforms such as GNSDK or Mobile Client.
