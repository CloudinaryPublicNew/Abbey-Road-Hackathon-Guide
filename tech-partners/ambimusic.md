# AmbiMusic

Ambimusic is a cloud based music management system for businesses: it allows to play fine-tailored music for public spaces, restaurants, hotels and every place where the right music background matters. Ambimusic's CMS allows the control of a virtually infinite fleet of background music players, each playing a specific background music. 

**Ambimusic will provide free access to their CMS and cloud-based storage for teams participating at the Hackathon.**
