# AmbiMusic

Ambimusic is a cloud based music management system for businesses: it allows you to play fine-tailored music for public spaces, restaurants, hotels and every place where the right background music matters. AmbiMusic's CMS allows the control of a virtually infinite fleet of background music players, each playing a specific background music. 

**Ambimusic will provide free access to their CMS and cloud-based storage for participants.**

Participants wishing to use Ambimusic Music Management CMS for their hacks can navigate to a sandbox environment at the address: [https://staging.ambimusic.com](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstaging.ambimusic.com&data=02%7C01%7CDominika.Dronska%40abbeyroad.com%7C5c19a5e73f0e4800ff7808d642b0c201%7Cbbcb6b2f8c7c4e2486e46c36fed00b78%7C1%7C0%7C636769724300162385&sdata=XEkfItes0ydNNK8JuUvwbijlJnOlbHPm5kMsH2mk09s%3D&reserved=0)
