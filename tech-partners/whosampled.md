_The WhoSampled API provides access to technology and data from the world's largest music discovery service focused on Music DNA, i.e. sample-based music, cover songs and remixes. An overview can be found here:_ [_https://www.whosampled.com/metadata/_](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.whosampled.com%2Fmetadata%2F&data=02%7C01%7CDominika.Dronska%40abbeyroad.com%7Ca51dacf3be0443f1106e08d63fff502c%7Cbbcb6b2f8c7c4e2486e46c36fed00b78%7C1%7C0%7C636766763145863640&sdata=L3AS6PFidhKMBWhAlR1g6yE5YxVz24tIcdIM8XPF4SI%3D&reserved=0)\_\_

We'll then send you your API key and documentation for the API. The deadline for applying to an API key is Tuesday November 6th at 5pm GMT.**

**\*\* Please note that technical support for the WhoSampled API will not be available during the hackathon, so we recommend testing it before the event.** 

The WhoSampled API is made available to support demos/prototypes of user-initiated actions using a low volume of API calls. We do not allow accessing and caching large amounts of data in bulk. Any data obtained during the hackathon must be deleted after the event.

Following the event, any continued use of the WhoSampled API or any software that was created using it must be agreed with WhoSampled.
