# Hackoustic

![](../.gitbook/assets/hackoustic-logo.jpg)

Hackoustic will be providing a hardware hacking den complete with 3D printers, tools and supplies, plus support and mentorship for any teams that take on a hardware challenge. They will also be building their own installation overnight to be unveiled at the judging ceremony! Hackoustic will be on hand with tools, materials, miscellaneous boards and a few 3D printers, but if there are specific things you think youâ€™ll need, let Tom know at [vulpestruments@gmail.com](mailto:vulpestruments@gmail.com)
