![](../.gitbook/assets/chirp-logo.png)

Chirp is a wireless communication technology for exchanging data between nearby devices via sound - one device takes any data, converts it into sound, which nearby devices convert that sound back into the original data. It uses any existing speaker or microphone, and is configurable to use audible or inaudible near-ultrasonic frequencies.  
  
Chirp is designed for simplicity, eliminating connectivity headaches and simplifying everyday tasks like connecting to Wi-Fi networks, sharing contact details, and making peer-to-peer payments. It's trusted by companies and developers across the world, from nuclear power stations to children's toys.
